Graph Theory with Sets
======================

So basically, I find some graph theory proofs appeal somewhat to
pictures/intuition, instead of what a graph actually is - a pair of sets.
Especially in the study of representations/embeddings/planarity.

Mostly a proof-of-concept; making definitions and proofs rigourous by breaking
things down to sets and so on.

In real life, proofs this rigourous are just a waste of time, but it's good to
know that they exist.
